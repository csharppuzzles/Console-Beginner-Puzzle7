## Puzzles
In Program.cs, I have commented out some starting code for these puzzles. <br />
Write your code in these sections and uncomment them. <br />
I have provided some examples of similar functions to what each puzzle is asking for. Learn to read the code and modify it. <br />

At the very bottom, I have listed the functions. Comment and uncomment them, to run them one at a time.

```
// Run the puzzles

    exampleA()
    // puzzleA()

    exampleB()
    // puzzleB()

    exampleC()
    // puzzleC()
```
